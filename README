Available Binary Distributions
==============================

Server Distributions
--------------------
* Airavata Server
  The Airavata Server binary distribution allows you to run a standalone Airavata Server which includes all the airavata services 
  shipped with a default derby database as the backend registry. For stable purposes, a mysql configuration is recommended. 

Client Distributions
--------------------

* Airavata Client
  The Airavata Client distribution is a set of libraries and configurations files that allow a 3rd party application to
  programatically  access Airavata functionality through Airavata API.
  
 How to test and run samples
===========================
* If you built Airavata from source, and if you see "BUILD SUCCESS", then the test cases should have passes.
* The test cases are beyond unit level, they startup embedded services and run through basic workflow use cases.
* To walk through Airavata features, follow "Airavata in Five Minutes" tutorial at http://airavata.apache.org/documentation/tutorials/airavata-in-5-minutes.html. 
* For intermediate level Airavata features, follow "Airavata in Ten Minutes" tutorial at http://airavata.apache.org/documentation/tutorials/airavata-in-5-minutes.html.
* For advanced use cases, please contact mailing lists - http://airavata.apache.org/community/mailing-lists.html
